Crime forecasting: a machine learning and computer vision approach to crime prediction

**ABSTRACT**
This paper offers a comprehensive analysis in computer vision 
approaches for crime predicting, with a particular emphasis on 
fingerprint detection. The Soko dataset, a comprehensive and varied 
set of fingerprints, is used in the study to create and assess a reliable 
crime prediction model. Utilizing computer vision technologies in 
conjunction with crime predicting, police enforcement tactics will be 
improved, and criminal activity will be prevented and resolved. In 
order to anticipate and address criminal activity in a proactive manner, 
crime forecasting is an essential component of contemporary law 
enforcement. Recent developments in computer vision technologies 
have created new opportunities to improve crime prediction and 
detection. Using the Soko Dataset, this paper provides a thorough 
review of fingerprint detection, utilising computer vision techniques 
to increase the precision and efficiency of crime forecasting.
